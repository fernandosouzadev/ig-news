## ðŸš€ Technologies and Libraries

Project developed with the following technologies:

- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- NextJS
- Stripe (online payment platform, in which its API was used to carry out registrations)
- Next Auth (authentication system to perform the login system with API Routes)
- FaunaDB (recommended database for Serveless functions)
- Prismic CMS (CMS platform that contains the contents of the posts that will be consumed in the code with its API)
- Jest and Testing Library (framework and library for testing)

## ðŸ“– Concepts

Notes of concepts studied:

- page rendering
  - Client Side Rendering (CSR; information is loaded from some user action; when it does not need indexing in Google)
  - Server Side Rendering (SSR; html information is updated in real time; it's different for each user; when it needs indexing in Google)
  - Static Site Generation (SSG; same html shared for all users, in which the information is updated every so long time determined in the code; when it needs indexing in Google)
- Routes API (they are executed using the Serveless concept, in which the routes do not create a 24-hour server running like Axios, it only goes up and down the environments as they are called)
- Authentication strategies
  - JWT (saved in storage; has expiration date)
  - Next Auth (simple system; independent of the back end; has an expiration date; used when you need to login with a social system, for example Facebook or GitHub; used when you do not want to store user access credentials; information is stored in cookies )
  - Cognito, Auth0 (external authentication providers; integrate with Next Auth; store user data)
- JAMStack (JavaScript API Markup; concept of complete applications that depend less on a back end)
- CMS (Content Management System; projects with ready-made administration panel and it is possible to create content inside; example Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento)
- Headless CMS (Administration Panel + HTTP API, GraphQL, SDK; example Strapi, Ghost, Keystone, GraphCMS, Prismic CMS, Contentful, Shopify, Saleor)
- Jest
  - Mock (function that simulates an operation different from the real one for external functionalities of the code for the execution of tests)
- TestingLibrary
  - Testing Playground (function that generates a URL with an interface where it is possible to see all the html generated by the component and the exact codes possible to test these certain rendered components)
  - Coverage report (function that generates a report that shows whether the tests already done in the project are sufficient and which parts of the code the tests done are covering and not covering)

## ðŸ’» Project

ig.news is a blog post listing. It was developed during the Chapter III classes of the Bootcamp Ignite ReactJS track by Rocketseat, and the unit tests made were developed later during the Chapter V classes, and in it it is possible to log in with a GitHub account and pay a monthly subscription to view full posts or not pay and view only a few opening paragraphs.

## ðŸ”– Layout

You can view the project layout through [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/gl0fHkQgvaUfXNjuwGtDDs/ig.news?node-id=1%3A2). You must have an account at [Figma](https://figma.com) to access it.

## âš™ Clone and run

```bash
# Open a terminal and copy this repository with the command
$ git clone https://github.com/fernandosouzadev/ig-news.git
```

```bash
# Create a .env.local file and put the environment variables based on the .env.example file, which
# requires some knowledge to create and configure them in each respective application, Stripe,
# GitHub, FaunaDB and Prismic
# In the online project that is available I added them in Vercel itself, so it works there
$ cp .env.example .env.local

# Install the dependencies
$ yarn
```

```bash
# For the subscription system to work, it is necessary to download the latest version of the stripe-cli at
# https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/tag/v1.5.14, and in the folder that contains it open a cmd
# and run the following command to listen for events deployed in /src/pages/api/webhooks
$ stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks
# To test a valid credit card for the purchase, fill in the number
# 4242 4242 4242 4242, and the rest of the information with anything

# Start the application
$ yarn dev

```
